Baseball analytics is a game-changer, unlocking new levels of performance and strategy. But advanced Statcast data remains exclusive—limited to MLB stadiums with expensive, sensor-based tracking systems.

This leaves amateur players, coaches, and scouts without access to affordable, high-precision analytics, creating a massive gap between aspiring athletes and elite-level insights.

Now, imagine a world where every baseball player and fan—from Little League to the Majors—can access MLB-level analytics in real time.

Ta-da! Meet Statcast++—the game-changer for game-changers.

Statcast++ is a cutting-edge AI-powered baseball performance tracking system that redefines how the game is analyzed and experienced. It instantly extracts key metrics such as real-time ball and bat velocities, precise distances, and dynamic trajectories, offering fans and analysts unparalleled insights. But what truly sets Statcast++ apart is its ability to seamlessly capture the magic moment—the very instant when bat meets ball, transforming raw data into a breathtaking spectacle. Whether you're a die-hard fan or a performance-driven coach, immerse yourself in the game like never before with real-time analytics and beautifully captured moments.

At the heart of Statcast++ lies the power of Computer Vision and Machine Learning, enabling it to extract Statcast-level metrics from any video. We leveraged the YOLO model to precisely detect the bat and ball in every frame, tracking their motion to estimate speeds through frame-by-frame displacement. Google Colab provided a seamless training ground for our deep learning models, harnessing cloud GPUs to accelerate development without the need for high-end local hardware.

But we didn’t stop there. Vertex AI supercharged our system, allowing for scalable deployment and real-time analysis—delivering instant insights as the action unfolds. Our modeling and analysis are rooted in the MLB dataset, ensuring professional-grade accuracy.

Yet, Statcast++ isn’t just about stats—it’s about revolutionizing the way the game is experienced. Fans are no longer passive spectators; they’re immersed in the rhythm of the game with real-time ball and bat velocities, dynamic trajectories, and the electrifying instant of impact—all elegantly visualized in their favorite plays.

More importantly, we’re democratizing performance tracking. No longer is elite analytics reserved for MLB teams with expensive radars and sensors. With just a smartphone camera, players at any level can unlock MLB-grade insights, fine-tune their game, and relive their biggest moments like the pros.

This is baseball analytics redefined—one pitch, one swing, one unforgettable moment at a time.
